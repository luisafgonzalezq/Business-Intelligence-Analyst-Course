# Excercices 1 to 5
Load the employes db.sql

Inside the script there are the excercices description and solutions

## Exercise #1
Execute a query that sets employees_10 as the default database.

## Exercise #2
Retrieve all records from the employees table.
You might consider exploring two ways of writing the query. 
In one version, specify the database where the employees table is stored. 
In the other, assume it is understood that we are referring to the employees_10 database.
Also, please note that unlike when working locally with MySQL Workbench,
you might find that the output here is automatically ordered in a different way.
